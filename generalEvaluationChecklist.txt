Suggested things that a general evalutor can report on.  The GE of the day may very well have a different and valid opinion on what contitutes a good meeting.

Preperation
* Was the banner there?
* Did the meeting start on time?
* To prevent floor crossing, were their 2 chairs on either side
  1. somewhere within the speaker's view
  2. in a non-awkward position that does not hinder mouvement?
* Did the table topics master have the castanet award ready?

All roles
* Did all speakers prompt the chair, table topics or general evaluator when it was time to return, and extended their hand to shake (culture permitting)?

All meeting
* Were there crossing in front of the lectern?
* Was clapping sufficient (usually until the speaker arrives at lectern or back at seat)?
* Was the scheduler sent arround?

Introductions
* Did experience guests turn arround to look at the audience?

Chair
* Especially if there are guests, was the congradulation made for the first speech (the intro)?
* Were minor roles instructed from where ("standing from where you are" or "come to the the lectern") to do their roles and how (standing, sitting)
* What do you think could be done better?

Word of the day
* For word of the day, was it clearly displayed at the front?  Would you put it in different place?

Timer
* Did the timer sufficiently raise the card for long enough for the cards to be seen by the speaker

Toast
* For the toast, was the prompting done clearly and without ambiguity, that is, a prompt:
    1. First to get up
    2. Then to raise your glass
    3. To ______ (one very short 3-5 sentence)  ________

Table topics
* Was it explained that participants are free to diverge from the subject
* Was there no ambiguity as to from where participants are expected to do their speeches?
* If participants were delivering from the front,
    - did the table topics master clear the area completely but stayed in view of the participant?
    - Were the volunteers called on their turn (rather than all of them at the same time)?
* Did the participants prompt the table topics master back when they were done?
* Were the participants reminded in the intro of TT that they are speaking to the audience?
* What do you think could be done better?

Speech evaluations
* Did the chair or speech evaluators point out to the audience about the evaluation sheets before speaking?
* Were the speech evaluations on delivery and not on content?  If some feedback was on content, should the exception have been indicated and was it?
* Were the speech evaluations original and not read from the manual?
* What do you think could be done better?

Reports or other minor roles
* Were roles (usually reports) done from the desk (and not at lectern) still done standing up?  Did the chair clearly indicate that?
