Suggested things that a general evalutor can report on.  The GE of the day may of course have a different and valid opinion on what contitutes a good meeting.

Preperation
* Was the banner there? (though this requires allot of work if it is not on site)
* Did the meeting start on time?
* To prevent floor crossing, were their 2 chairs on either side
  1. somewhere within the speaker's view 
  2. in a non-awkward position that does not hinder mouvement?
* Did the speech evaluators have the speaker's manuals and ready for the reading of the executive summary & objectives?

All roles
* Did all speakers prompt the chair, table topics or general evaluator when it was time to return, and extended their hand to shake (culture permitting)?

All meeting
* Were there crossing in front of the lectern?
* Was clapping sufficient (usually until the speaker arrives at lectern or back at seat)?
* Was the scheduler sent arround?

Introductions
* Did experience guests turn arround to look at the audience?

Chair
* Especially if there are guests, was the congradulation made for the first speech (the intro)?
* If time permitted and if there are guests, were the CC & CL explained?
* Was there no ambiguity in terms of from where the minor roles should be done (timer, gramarian, castanets) or doing standing or sitting? 

Minor segments
* For word of the day, was it clearly displayed at the front (or, for the speaker's benefit, to the side)?
* For the toast, was the prompting for (a) the standing up and (b) the toast done clearly and without ambiguity ?

Evaluators intro
* Did speech evaluators, between reading the summary and speech objectives,  indicate:
  1. the evaluation sheets in front of them
  2. You may use your own criterias or the following objectives to help you with your evaluation of the speaker

Table topics 
* Was it explained that participants are free to diverge from the subject
* Was there no ambiguity as to from where participants are expected to do their speeches? 

Speech evaluations
* Were the speech evaluations on delivery and not on content?  If some feedback was on content, should the exception had been indicated?
* Were the speech evaluations original and not read from the manual?

Reports or other minor roles
* Were roles (usually reports) done from the desk (and not at lectern) still done standing up?  Did the chair clearly indicate that?
