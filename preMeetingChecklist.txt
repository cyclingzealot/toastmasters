Pre-meeting checklist

* Name plates distributed

* To prevent floor crossing, were their 2 chairs on either side
  1. somewhere within the speaker's view 
  2. in a non-awkward position that does not hinder mouvement?

 * Did the speech evaluators have the speaker's manuals and ready for the reading of the executive summary & objectives?

* All roles assigned?

* All changes written on the chair's agenda?
